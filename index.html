    <h1> THE STORY OF DOG AND BONE</h1>
    <h3>Written by Daniel Errico</h3>
    <p>Once, there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food. One day, he found a big juicy
        bone, and he immediately grabbed it in his mouth and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw
        another dog with a bone in its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself, too. But as he opened his mouth, the bone
        he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.</p>
    <h4>Lesson:</h4>
    <h4>If we always envy others, weâ€™ll lose what we already have, just like the greedy dog.</h4>
